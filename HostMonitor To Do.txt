HostMonitor To Do:

Implement option to edit hosts file
Do a proper about window
From https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=23378&p=112339#p112339 :
    Look into adding graph on main window
    Look into changning yellow to indicate something more useful than refresh (possible if latency above user setting)
Improve tracert script for gracefully handling when there is no name resolution instead of just dying
Implement logging (failures/high latency in main script, full in graph script if enabled)
PingAvg setting to not require reload
