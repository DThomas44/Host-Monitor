From https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=23378&p=112339#p112339 :
    Look into adding graph on main window
Rework logging system to keep log file open during logging operations to reduce disk operations/improve performance.
    Open log when starting scan cycle, close after complete.
Look into https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=6194 as a better way to multi-thread.
Find cause of double entry for logging being finished when script is closed.
    Only single entry if logging is stoped via menu.
